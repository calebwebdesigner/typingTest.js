# typingTest.js
Just a simple Javascript typing game, have a go and see how high of a score you can get! (:

Open the index.html file, and begin typing. The wordlist was created from the rockyou.txt password dump so you might have a few number strings pop up.

The timer and clock are intentionally hard to see so as not to distract you while you type.
