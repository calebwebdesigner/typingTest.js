# typingTest.js
Just a simple Javascript typing game, I made this around January 2020 when I was just starting to learn Javascript.

Open the index.html file, and begin typing. The wordlist was created from the rockyou.txt password dump so you might have a few number strings pop up.

The timer and clock are intentionally hard to see so as not to distract you while you type.
