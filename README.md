# typingTest.js
Just a simple typing game coded in Javascript, I made this around the end of 2019 when I was learning Javascript. I thought to upload it here as a momento of my first moments with Javascript, and as a reminder of how far I'm progressing each day.

**Instructions:**
Just open the index.html file, and then begin typing. 

The wordlist was taken from a part of the infamous rockyou.txt password dump, and the timer and clock are intentionally somewhat hard to see so as not to distract you while you type.
