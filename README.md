# typingTest.js
Just a simple typing game coded in Javascript, I made this around the end of 2019 when I was learning Javascript. I thought to upload it here as a momento of my first moments with Javascript, and as a reminder of how far I'm progressing each day.

**Instructions:**
Just open the index.html file, and then begin typing. The wordlist was created from the infamous rockyou.txt password dump.

The timer and clock are intentionally somewhat hard to see so as not to distract you while you type.
